**My Code** is code I wrote myself. Sometimes from completely scratch, sometimes it started as something in the book and I modified or expanded it a bunch.

**Book Examples** is code from the books that I would tinker with along the way.

### Books I've read
- Automate The Boring Stuff With Python, Al Sweigart
- Python Crash Course, Eric Matthes
- Learning Python, Mark Lutz **(In progress)**
